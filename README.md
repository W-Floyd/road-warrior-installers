# Road Warrior Installers

Inspired by Nyr's [openvpn-install script](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install), this is a collection of scripts meant to make installation (and possibly management) of various self hosted web-services easy.

When the scripts say they will break existing setups, they're not joking, you really will be messed up. I make these scripts for myself, no promises that they'll work for others.
